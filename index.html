        <p>So, how do these things work? I'm new to Web Development with experience in digital marketing and sustainability with a focus on renewable energy. I am a musician and have spent most of my life writing and performing in various projects.</p>
        <p>I grew up on foodstamps with parents who were both drug addicts with virtually no sense of proper mental health.</p>
        <p>I am looking to shake the cycle of poverty and become finacially independent, set a good example for my younger brother,and have the funds available to help with not only my retirement but my parents end of life care as well. </p>
